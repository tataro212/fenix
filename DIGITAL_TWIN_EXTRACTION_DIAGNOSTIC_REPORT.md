# Digital Twin Pipeline Extraction Diagnostic Report

## 1. Objective

**Goal:**
Troubleshoot and optimize the Digital Twin pipeline's handling of document structureâ€”specifically, the extraction, preservation, and reconstruction of paragraphs, titles, and other structural elements during PDF translation and processing.

## 2. Investigation Process

### What We Searched For
- **Where and how structural information is extracted** from PDFs in the digital twin pipeline.
- **How block types (title, heading, paragraph, list, etc.) are assigned** during extraction.
- **Whether YOLO (DocLayNet) layout predictions are used** as the primary signal for block type assignment.
- **If batching or translation steps are responsible for loss or misclassification of structure.**
- **Whether paragraph boundaries and block order are preserved** throughout the pipeline.

### How We Searched
- Inspected the extraction logic in `pymupdf_yolo_processor.py` and related files.
- Used a debug/inspection mode to print the extracted structure (block types, roles, and text) for a problematic PDF.
- Compared the extracted structure to the original document and the final output.

## 3. Key Findings

### A. Extraction Output
- **Paragraphs are present** and not merged into a single block.
- **List items and footnotes are detected** and classified.
- **Some long, paragraph-like blocks are misclassified as `title` or `heading`.**
- **YOLO is running and detecting layout areas,** but the final block type assignment may not be using YOLO's class prediction as the main authority.
- **Orphaned content blocks** (not linked to a heading/section) are present, as warned by the validation logic.

### B. Root Cause
- **Block type misclassification** (especially long paragraphs as titles) is a major issue.
- This is likely due to the block type classification logic over-relying on font size, position, or PyMuPDF heuristics, rather than YOLO's class prediction.
- **Batching and translation do not appear to be the primary cause** of paragraph loss; the issue is present at extraction.

## 4. Proposed Optimizations

### 1. Prioritize YOLO Class for Block Type Assignment
- **Use YOLO's predicted class as the primary signal** for block type (title, heading, paragraph, list, etc.).
- Use font size, position, and other heuristics only as secondary signals or for tie-breaking.
- Update the `_classify_text_block_type` and YOLO mapping logic in `pymupdf_yolo_processor.py` accordingly.

### 2. Add Debug Output for YOLO Class Mapping
- For each block, log both the YOLO class and the final assigned block type.
- This will help verify that the mapping is working as intended and catch future misclassifications early.

### 3. Improve Orphaned Block Handling
- Ensure all content blocks are linked to a section/heading if possible, to improve document navigation and structure.

### 4. Test and Validate
- After implementing the above, rerun extraction on problematic PDFs and inspect the structure.
- Confirm that paragraphs, titles, and other elements are correctly classified and preserved.

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Update block type assignment logic** to use YOLO's class as the main authority.
2. **Add debug output** for YOLO-to-block-type mapping.
3. **Test extraction** on known-problematic documents.
4. **Iterate and refine** based on results.
